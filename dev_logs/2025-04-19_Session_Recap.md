# KG iQ Bills Tracker - Session Recap: 2025-04-19

**Session Duration:** Approx. 4 hours (Ending ~1:20 PM EDT - *Adjust based on actual end time*)

**Focus Allocation (Estimated):**
* **Remediation & Troubleshooting:** ~30 minutes
    * *Includes fixing TS errors (unused imports, incorrect types for FullCalendar/Floating UI), debugging hover card visibility.*
* **Forward Momentum (Feature Development):** ~3 hours 30 minutes
    * *Includes reviewing lessons learned, implementing LoginForm, SignupForm, basic routing, ProtectedRoute, CalendarView component, data fetching for calendar events, hover card UI/logic (including Floating UI integration), defining/creating Allocations DB table.*

**Summary of Activities:**

Session 2 focused on building out the core features after establishing the foundational environment in Session 1. We moved from setup to implementation, creating the essential components for authentication, data entry, and visualization.

**Key Accomplishments:**

* **Session Review:** Started by reviewing lessons learned from Session 1 to guide today's workflow. Verified Node environment.
* **Auth Component Implementation (T7 Completed):**
    * Created `LoginForm.tsx` with state, validation, and successful `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` integration.
    * Created `SignupForm.tsx`, mimicking login structure with `supabase.auth.signUp` and confirm password field.
    * Added navigation links (`<Link>`) between Login and Signup forms.
* **Auth State Handling & Routing (T8 Completed):**
    * Refactored auth state logic from `App.tsx` into `HomePage.tsx` initially.
    * Implemented basic page routing in `App.tsx` using `react-router-dom` (`<Routes>`, `<Route>`) for `/`, `/login`, `/signup`.
    * Created placeholder page components (`LoginPage.tsx`, `SignupPage.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`).
    * Implemented `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to check Supabase auth status and redirect unauthenticated users from `/` to `/login`. Updated `App.tsx` routes accordingly.
    * Simplified `HomePage.tsx` after `ProtectedRoute` implementation.
* **Form Implementation (T12, T13 Completed):**
    * Implemented `AddIncomeForm.tsx` with fields matching DB schema, state management, validation, and successful Supabase `insert` logic.
    * Created Supabase function `get_distinct_income_sources` and integrated results into `AddIncomeForm` using `<datalist>` for autocomplete.
    * Implemented `AddBillForm.tsx` similarly, successfully inserting into `bill_events`, and adding payee autocomplete via `get_distinct_bill_payees` function.
* **Calendar Implementation (T10, T11 Completed):**
    * Installed FullCalendar packages (`@fullcalendar/react`, `@fullcalendar/daygrid`) (T10 Done).
    * Created `CalendarView.tsx` component, rendering a basic calendar grid.
    * Implemented data fetching in `CalendarView` to get `income_events` and `bill_events` from Supabase based on `user_id`.
    * Formatted fetched data for FullCalendar's `events` prop, applying custom KG iQ colors and currency formatting.
    * Implemented hover cards (`IncomeEventCard.tsx`, `BillEventCard.tsx`) triggered by `eventMouseEnter`/`Leave`. Refactored positioning logic using `@floating-ui/react` to handle viewport boundaries and reduce jitter. Resolved associated TypeScript errors.
* **Allocation Table (T14 Completed):**
    * Defined and created the `allocations` table schema in Supabase via SQL Editor, including foreign keys and RLS policies.
* **Git Workflow:** Practiced feature branching (briefly), committing logical units of work, and discussing PR strategy. User demonstrated proficiency with `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`. Clarified CLI flags (`-p`, `-m`) and merge context.

**Challenges & Resolutions:**

* **TypeScript Errors:** Encountered and resolved several TS/ESLint errors related to unused imports/variables (e.g., `React`, `useRef`, `Outlet`, `Session`) and incorrect type usage for FullCalendar event handlers (`EventHoveringArg`). Fixed by removing unused code/imports and correcting type annotations.
* **Hover Card Positioning:** Initial manual positioning logic for hover cards failed near viewport edges. Refactored successfully using `@floating-ui/react` library.
* **Hover Card Visibility:** Temporary issue where hover cards didn't appear after refactoring. Diagnosed via console logs â€“ interaction listeners weren't firing correctly when attached via `eventDidMount`. Resolved by reverting to using FullCalendar's `eventMouseEnter`/`Leave` props to manage state and set Floating UI's reference element.

**Current Status & Next Steps:**

The application now has a functional authentication flow, working data entry forms for income and bills, and a calendar view displaying these events with informative hover cards. The database schema for tracking allocations is in place.

The next step is **T15: Implement Allocation UI/Logic**, likely starting with handling clicks on calendar events to initiate the allocation process.
