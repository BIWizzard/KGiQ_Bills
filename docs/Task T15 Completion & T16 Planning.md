# Task T15 Completion & T16 Planning

## T15 - Implement Allocation UI/Logic (COMPLETED)

### What We Accomplished:
- Created a reusable Modal component for the application
- Built an AllocationForm component that displays available income sources and their remaining amounts
- Implemented click handlers on bill events in the calendar to open the allocation modal
- Added allocation creation with Supabase integration
- Implemented a financial summary section on the homepage showing:
  - Total income and allocated/remaining amounts
  - Total bills and allocation coverage
  - Bills with allocations count
- Added error handling for when the allocations table doesn't exist
- Optimized performance with React.useMemo for expensive calculations

### Current Limitations:
- Bills are treated as one-time events without status tracking
- No visual indicator of allocation status on the calendar
- Partial payments don't update the bill's remaining balance
- No dedicated allocation management interface

### Ready for PR to Main:
âœ… Yes, T15 is complete and can be committed to main. The core allocation functionality works, allowing users to:
- View a summary of their financial situation
- Create allocations between income and bills
- See real-time updates when allocations are created

## T16 - Enhanced Allocation System with Visual Indicators (PLANNED)

### Proposed Enhancements:
1. **Update Database Schema**
   - Add `status` field to bill_events (unpaid, scheduled, paid)
   - Add `remaining_amount` field to bill_events to track balance
   - Update RLS policies for new fields

2. **Enhance Allocation UI**
   - Show bill remaining balance in the allocation form
   - Allow partial allocations with remaining balance tracking
   - Update bill status based on allocation amount
   - Add ability to handle multiple allocations to the same bill

3. **Visual Calendar Indicators**
   - Add color coding or icons for different bill statuses
   - Display remaining amount for partially paid bills
   - Implement hover card enhancements to show allocation status

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Memoize expensive calculations to improve performance
   - Add type definitions for enhanced bill schema
   - Update existing components to handle the new fields

### Implementation Approach:
1. Start with database schema updates in Supabase
2. Update shared type definitions
3. Modify the AllocationForm to handle partial payments 
4. Enhance the CalendarView for visual indicators
5. Update the financial summary to show more detailed status information

### Estimated Timeline:
Approximately one development session (2-3 hours) to implement these enhancements.
